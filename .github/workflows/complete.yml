# Unlike most model workflows and templates, which put all of the relevant 
# GitHub Actions in one or two files, this template takes a different approach,
# consistent with the typical "separation of concerns" principles of modern
# coding. This workflow uses the "call-workflow" instruction and the 
# on: "workflow_call" trigger to make it easier to change or create alternate
# workflows.
